# StarGateLock
Well you saw me in the youtube comments I do not lie

you need python for this but basically put all of this in a folder run stargate.py then set a password it will generate its own .json with up to 9 symbol combination after you have put what you want for it click the dhd to save it after that it will check if the new code matches the password, its not done yet so not fully functional
